            <Typography>Online tests are used early in the recruitment process to filter through large volumes of
              applications. These tests can take many forms and are all designed to assess different qualities but there
              are lots of sites that provide practice tests. The focus of psychometric tests is not on what you answer
              but how you answer the question so they vary for each application.

            <Typography>Employers also use Numerical/Verbal/Logical Reasoning tests to explore how well a candidate
              reasons with numerical, written or diagrammatical data. Unlike other psychometric tests, these do have
              right and wrong answers and are multiple choice and timed. Many of the skills required for reasoning tests
              can be improved by regularly exercising brain with puzzles such as Sudoku or crosswords.
