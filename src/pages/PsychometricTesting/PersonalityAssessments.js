              is to assess if YOU are the ideal candidate, which can only be achieved if you answer honestly. Make sure
              you read all of the options before answering and remain consistent throughout.

              types
              are based on four distinct traits and an underlying identity aspect:

            <Typography>The Caliper Profile is an objective assessment that measures an individualâ€™s personality
              characteristics and individual motivations in order to predict on-the-job behaviors and potential. The
              results show key personality traits related to skills within the job environment. The test is split into a
              behavioural section and a cognitive section, and will take a couple of hours to complete. Caliper Profiles
              are tailored for different jobs so the results will vary between applications.
