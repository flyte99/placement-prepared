            <Typography>There are a vast variety of personally assessments used by employers to find appropriate
              candidates. It&apos;s important to not to focus on giving the &quot;right&ldquo; answers because the aim
              is to assess if YOU are the ideal candidate, which can only be achieved if you answer honestly. Make sure
              you read all of the options before answering and remain consistent throughout.

            <Typography>The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test is a very popular personality assessment that uses a
              series of questions to categorise people into one of 16 different personality types. These personality
              types
              are based on four distinct traits and an underlying identity aspect:

            <Typography>The Caliper Profile is an objective assessment that measures an individualâ€™s personality
              characteristics and individual motivations in order to predict on-the-job behaviors and potential. The
              results show key personality traits related to skills within the job environment. The test is split into a
              behavioural section and a cognitive section, and will take a couple of hours to complete. Caliper Profiles
              are tailored for different jobs so the results will vary between applications.
