            <Typography>MySQL is regularly used in industry to manage relational databases. A relational database
              organises data into one or more tables in which data types may be related to each other, which helps
              structure the data. MySQL uses Structured Query Language (SQL), like many other relational database
              management systems, which makes it easy to transfer between using different systems. SQL statements direct
              a server to perform certain operations on a database such as requesting information, modifying the data or
              defining data types. Some standard rules for writing SQL statements are:

                <Typography>The SELECT statement allows you to read data from one or more tables. SELECT queries are
                  follow the format of &quot;SELECT &lt;list of columns or expression you want to show in the
                  result&gt; FROM &lt;name of table(s)&gt;;&ldquo;. Using an &quot;*&ldquo; will select everything from
                  a table but it is best practice to avoid using this for simplicity, security and disk usage
                  reasons.

                <Typography color="textPrimary" variant="h3">Sorting Data</Typography> <br />
                <Typography>A SELECT statement can be followed by ORDER BY to sort the result. Columns that should be
                  sorted are specified after the ORDER BY clause where ASC sorts the result set in ascending order and
                  DESC sorts in descending order. By default, the ORDER BY clause uses ASC if you donâ€™t explicitly
                  specify any option. If you want to sort the result set by multiple columns, you specify a
                  comma-separated list of columns in the ORDER BY clause. When columns are being sorted in different
                  ways, the result in sorted in order of the columns specified.

                <Typography>A relational database consists of multiple related tables linking together using common
                  columns which are known as foreign key columns. A join is a method of linking data between one
                  (self-join) or more tables based on values of the common column between the tables. The join clause is
                  used in the SELECT statement after the FROM clause. MySQL supports the following types of join:
