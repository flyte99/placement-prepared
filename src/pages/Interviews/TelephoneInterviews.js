            <Typography>Telephone interviews are often used at an early stage of the graduate recruitment process to
              filter applicants and decide who to invite to a second interview or assessment centre. The questions are
              likely to focus more on your general competencies and skills, and it&apos;s a good opportunity to show
              your enthusiasm and commitment in a short conversation. You could also be given a structured assessment
              such as a personality test over the phone. For example, your interviewer might read out a series of
              statements on areas such as working on your own, and ask you to rate how well these reflect your
              preferences. From the employer&apos;s point of view, they provide useful insights into your verbal
              communication skills.

            <Typography>It&apos;s normal to be nervous before a telephone interview, but it will really help if you know
              you&apos;ve done the groundwork. Make sure you find out as much as you can about the recruiter. Read the
              job description carefully and think about how you match the selection criteria. Write down any questions
              you might like to ask, as well as planning answers to those questions you think are likely to come up such
              as&quot;Tell me about yourself&ldquo; and &quot;What interests you in the job?&ldquo;. If you feel you
              need more experience of using the phone in a professional context to build your confidence, ask a friend,
              a relative or someone at your careers service to help. Theyâ€™ll be able to give you feedback on how you
              come across by phone. You could also record yourself so that you can listen back and identify any
              problems, such as speaking too quietly or quickly.
