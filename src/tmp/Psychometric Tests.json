These tests can take many forms and are all designed to assess different qualities but there are lots of sites that provide practice tests. The focus of psychometric tests is not on what you answer but how you answer the question so they vary for each application.",

Unlike other psychometric tests, these do have right and wrong answers and are multiple choice and timed. Many of the skills required for reasoning tests can be improved by regularly exercising brain with puzzles such as Sudoku or crosswords.",

        "Numerical reasoning tests are typically questions on basic GCSE maths concepts such as ratios, percentages and probability",

Verbal reasoning tests donâ€™t typically assess your ability to write fluently or persuasively, they are more focused on your understanding",
        "Logical reasoning tests assess your ability to spot rules or consistencies in sets of objects and your logical thinking. They focus on your ability to work quickly and accurately"
