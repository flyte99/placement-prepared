      "material": "An advantage of an in-person assessment centre is that you visit the employer’s offices, talk to employees and get a sense of whether you can see yourself working there. This is harder to do on a virtual platform. Although some companies have put together videos of their teams and offices for candidates to watch beforehand, it is not quite the same. It is useful to ask questions that will help you work out whether the employer will suit you (this could be during your interview or in an information session). Asking \"What do you like best about working here?\" will get you the information you seek in a tactful way. If you are made an offer by an employer, its recruiters will answer any questions you have if you are still making up your mind. They may also put you in touch with current employees for an informal chat."

Recruiters build in time to check that the technology is working. They also leave time for comfort and refreshment breaks. You usually log into a video or specifically designed assessment platform and for certain activities, you may go off into separate \"rooms\" with other candidates. It is usual to be given detailed information before the assessment centre to help you prepare and to put you at ease. For example:",
