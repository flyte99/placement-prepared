        "Research the organisation - When applying to opportunities you are likely to find organisations you hadn't heard of before so research what they do and their mission statement to show how you will enhance the team. It is helpful to keep up with current events especially news within the organisation's industry",
        "Research the job/role - Read the job description in full and consider what the job needs you to do (what might the challenges be? What about opportunities?). If you know someone working in the field, ask if you can talk to them and learn key topics for working in this area",
        "Make a list of the selection criteria and note down your evidence and key example(s) for each one",
        "Plan the practical elements - Your attire and travelling to the interview (allow plenty of time for traffic or public transport disruptions",
        "Make sure you listen to and make eye contact with the person who is speaking. In your reply address your answer to the person who asked the question, but also make eye contact with the other people present who are listening",
        "Of you worry about forgetting things to say, try noting down a few key bullet points that you can quickly glance at if needed"
