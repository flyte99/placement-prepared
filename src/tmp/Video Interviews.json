      "material": "These interviews have increased in popularity due to the coronavirus pandemic where traditional face-to-face interviews are done using video calling software such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams or Skype. Practising on your own before a video interview using your laptop to record yourself can be done to see how you come across on screen so adjustments can be made before the real interview. For example, check your body language and tone of voice to ensure you are not slouched and that you speak clearly at a pace where you can be easily understood. Having bullet pointed notes where you can see them easily can prompt answers if you find yourself struggling during the interview."

      "heading": "Pre-recorded Video Interviews",
      "material": "Pre-recorded or asynchronous video interviews are often used to filter candidates at an early stage and can be an alternative to phone interviews. They require candidates to respond to questions using an online video interface. Answers are recorded for the employer to review at a later date. There is usually a time limit for preparing your answer (e.g. 30 seconds) and then a time limit for answering the question (e.g. 2 minutes). Typically there is only one attempt to answer each question so it is important to practice questions beforehand and do the same preparation for video interviews as for in person interviews. An invitation to complete the interview will be emailed to you and you will need to complete it before a certain deadline. Itâ€™s common for employers to outsource pre-recorded video interviews to external organisations such as Sonru, SparkHire, HireVue, VidCruiter, LaunchPad and InterviewStream."
