Most employers will give you information before the assessment centre about the presentation exercise, and what they expect you to have prepared in advance. However, a small number of employers may set a presentation on the day providing a variety of topics to choose from and 15 minutes to prepare a 5 minute presentation. The typical competencies assessed in the presentation exercise are:",

        "Replace bullet point lists with a simple graphic alongside text to maintain the audience's focus",
