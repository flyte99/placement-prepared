    questionText: 'Dove soap chose a dove for their brand to give a sense of cleanliness and peace.',
    scenario: [
      'Brand equity has become a key asset in the world of competitive business. Indeed, some brands are now worth more than companies. Large corporations themselves are widely distrusted, whereas strangely, brands have the opposite effect on people. Brands are used to humanise corporations by appropriating characteristics such as courage, honesty, friendliness and fun. An example is Dove soap, where a dove represents white, cleanliness and peace. Volkswagen like to give the impression through their advertising that they are a reliable, clever, technical product. In a sense, rather than the product itself, the image and the idea are the selling point.'

    questionText: 'Financial statements are useful for businesses to understand their financial activities.',
    scenario: [
      'The first problem with financial statements is that they are in the past; however detailed, they provide just a snap-shot of the business at one moment in time. There is also a lack of detail in financial statements, giving little use in the running of a business. Financial statements are provided for legal reasons to meet with accounting regulations and are used mainly by City analysts who compute share prices and give guidance to shareholders. Accounts often have hidden information and may also be inconsistent; it is difficult to compare different companies’ accounts, despite there being standards, as there is much leeway in the standards.'

      'False - The passage says that financial statements have "a lack of detail in financial statements, giving little use in the running of a business", which is supported by other critical statements such as ‘the first problem with financial statements is that they are in the past" means they cannot be considered useful for businesses to understand their financial activities.'

    solution: [
      'Cannot Say - The last sentence in the passage says, "it is difficult to compare different companies’ accounts, despite there being standards, as there is much leeway in the standards". Though this implies that if there were less leeway in the standards, it would be easier to compare different companies’ accounts, this is only an inference. Thus, it can only be asserted as a probability rather than a certainty. Since the passage does not expressly say, we require more information. Therefore, it is cannot say.'
